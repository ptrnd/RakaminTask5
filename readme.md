## Introduction

As a Big Data Analyst Intern from Kimia Farma, I gained knowledge about data warehouses, data lakes, and data marts through this project. Also, I'm honing my SQL abilities. At the conclusion of the project, I requested that Kimia Farma develop a medicine sales dashboard using Google Data Studio utilizing the following real-world case dataset.
